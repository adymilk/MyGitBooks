# On Clothes 衣服

And the weaver said, "Speak to us of Clothes."
一位织工说，请给我们谈谈衣服。
And he answered:
他答道：
Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.
你们的衣服遮掩了你们许多的美，却不能遮盖住丑。
And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.
尽管你们借衣服寻求隐私的自由，但你们找到的却是羁绊和束缚。
Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment,
但愿你们用自己的肌肤而不是衣服去迎接阳光和清风，
For the breath of life is in the sunlight and the hand of life is in the wind.
因为阳光中有生命的气息，而风中有生命之手。
Some of you say, "It is the north wind who has woven the clothes to wear."
你们中一些人说：“是北风织造了我们所穿的衣服。”
But shame was his loom, and the softening of the sinews was his thread.
我说，是的，的确是北风，但它以羞怯为织机，以纤弱的肌腱为纱线。
And when his work was done he laughed in the forest.
它一旦完成工作，便会在林中大笑。
Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean.
不要忘记，羞怯原是抵挡不洁目光的盾牌。
And when the unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but a fetter and a fouling of the mind?
若无邪狎，那羞怯除了是精神上的束缚和污垢外还能是什么？
And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.
也不要忘记，大地乐于感觉体赤裸的双脚，风儿渴望与你的头发嬉戏。

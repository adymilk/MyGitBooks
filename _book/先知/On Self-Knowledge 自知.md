# On Self-Knowledge 自知

And a man said, "Speak to us of Self-Knowledge."
一位男子说，请给我们讲讲自知。
And he answered, saying:
他回答道：
Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.
你们的心灵在静默中领悟日夜的秘密。
But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.
你们的耳朵却渴望倾听你们心灵的知识。
You would know in words that which you have always know in thought.
你们想用语言了解你们一向用意识了解的事物。
You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.
你们想用你们的手指触摸你们梦想赤裸的身躯。
And it is well you should.
这正是你们该做的。
The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;
深藏在你们灵魂中不竭的源泉的确需要涌现，温湿地流向大海；
And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.
你们心中无限深处的宝藏将显露在你们的眼前。
But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;
但不要用天平称量你们不知的财富；
And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.
也不要用标竿或绳索测量你们的知识。
For self is a sea boundless and measureless.
因为自我是无边无际无从度量的大海。
Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, "I have found a truth."
不要说“我发现了真理”，而应说“我发现了一条真理”。
Say not, "I have found the path of the soul." Say rather, "I have met the soul walking upon my path."
不要说“我找到了灵魂的道路”，而应说“我遇到了漫步在我小径上的灵魂”。
For the soul walks upon all paths.
因为灵魂漫步于一切道路。
The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.
灵魂并非直线前进，也不像芦苇般成长。
The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.
灵魂伸展绽放，就像一朵有无数花瓣的莲花。

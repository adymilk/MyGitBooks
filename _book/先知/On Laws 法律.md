# On Laws 法律

Then a lawyer said, "But what of our Laws, master?"
然后，一位律师说，但我们的法律是怎样的呢，大师？
And he answered:
他答道：
You delight in laying down laws,
你们乐于立法，
Yet you delight more in breaking them.
但更乐于破坏它们。
Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.
如同海边玩耍的孩子，孜孜不倦地搭建沙塔，再笑着将它们破坏。
But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore,
不过当你们搭建沙塔时，大海又将更多的沙子带到海滩，
And when you destroy them, the ocean laughs with you.
而你们摧毁沙塔时，大海又与你们同笑。
Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.
的确，大海总是同天真无知的人一起嬉戏。
But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers,
但对那些生活不是海洋，人为的法律并非沙塔的人又如何呢？
But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness?
对于那些以生活为岩石，以法律为刻刀，以自身为原型，在石上雕凿的人又如何呢？
What of the cripple who hates dancers?
对嫉恨舞者的残疾呢？
What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things?
对喜欢挽轭，视林中康鹿为迷途流浪者的公牛呢？
What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless?
对无法蜕皮而称他人的赤裸为不知羞耻的老蛇呢？
And of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters law-breakers?
对那些早早来到婚宴，饱足疲倦后宣称一切宴会都是对法律的亵渎，所有赴宴者都是犯法者的人呢？
What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun?
对于这等人，除了说他们站在太阳下却背对太阳外，我还能说他们些什么呢？
They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws.
他们只看到自己的影子，这影子就是他们的法律。
And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows?
对他们来说，太阳除了投影者外还是什么呢？
And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth?
莫非承认法律只是屈背俯首者追随自己的投在地上的影子？
But you who walk facing the sun, what images drawn on the earth can hold you?
假如你们面向太阳行进，投射在大地上的阴影怎能将你们羁绊？
You who travel with the wind, what weathervane shall direct your course?
如果你们御风而行，什么样的风向标能为你们指示方向？
What man's law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man's prison door?
如果你们不在他人串门前打碎枷锁，人为的法律怎能将你们束缚？
What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man's iron chains?
如果你们跳舞而不碰撞任何人的铁链，有什么法律会令你们害怕呢？
And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man's path?
如果你们扯下衣衫，却不丢弃在任何人的路上，谁又会把你们带上法庭呢？
People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing?
奥法利斯城的人们啊，你们可以掩住鼓声，松弛琴弦，但谁又能够下令禁止云雀歌唱？

On Freedom自由
And an orator said, "Speak to us of Freedom."
一位演说家说，请给我们讲讲自由。
And he answered:
他答道：
At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom,
在城门边，在炉火旁，我曾看到你们五体投地，膜拜自己的自由，
Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.
就像奴隶在暴君面前卑躬屈膝，尽管他们倍受他的戕害。
Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.
唉，在庙宇的丛林中，在城堡的阴影下。我曾看到你们中最自由者披枷戴铐般穿戴着自己的自由。
And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfillment.
我的心在胸中滴血；因为只有当你们感到寻求自由的愿望也是一种束缚，只有当你们不再称自由是目标是成就时，你们才是自由的。
You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief,
当你们的白昼并非无忧无虑，你们的夜晚并非没有希望和悲伤，你们是自由的，
But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.
不过，当这些事物羁绊你们的生命，而你们超脱它们，赤裸而无拘无束，你们更是自由的。
And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?
你们在自己知识的黎明锁住了你们的正午，若不砸碎这锁链，你们如何能超越自己的昼夜？
In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle the eyes.
实际上，你们所谓的自由正是最坚固的锁链，虽然它的链环在阳光下闪耀，迷惑了你们的眼睛。
And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?
你们想要丢弃以换取自由的，难道不正是你们自身的一部分？
If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.
如果那是一个你们想要废除的法律，这法律正是由你们的手写在你们的额头上的。
You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.
你们无法将它抹去，即使你们焚毁律典或倾大海之水来冲洗法官的额头。
And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.
如果那是一个你们想要废黜的暴君，先看看他竖立在你们心中的宝座是否已被摧毁。
For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their won pride?
因为如果他们的自由里没有专制，他们的尊严中没有耻辱，暴君怎能统治自由尊严的人？
And if it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.
如果那是你们想要摆脱的焦虑，这焦虑并非强加于你们，而是你们的选择。
And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.
如果那是你们想要驱散的恐惧，这恐惧是根植在你们的心里，而非恐惧对象的手中。
Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape. These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.
的确，期望与恐惧，厌恶与珍惜，追求与逃避，所有这一切始终相拥相伴在你们体内运行，恰似光与影彼此紧紧相依相随。
And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.
当阴影消逝，驻留的光将成为另一道光的阴影。
And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.
因此，当你们的自由摆脱桎梏，它本身将会成为更大自由的桎梏。

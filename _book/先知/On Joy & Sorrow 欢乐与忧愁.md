# On Joy & Sorrow 欢乐与忧愁

Then a woman said, "Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow."
一位女子说，请给我们讲讲欢乐和忧愁。
And he answered:
他答道：
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
揭开面具，你们的欢乐就是你们的忧愁。
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
从你泪水注满的同一眼井中，你的欢乐泉涌。
And how else can it be?
能不如此吗？
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
哀愁刻划在你们身上的伤痕愈深，你们就能容纳愈多的欢乐。
Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?
难道不是曾经锻炼于陶工炉火中的杯盏，如今斟满你们的葡萄美酒？
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
难道不是曾经被利刃楼空的树木，如今成为抚慰你们心灵的鲁特琴？
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
当你们欣喜时，深究自己的心灵，你们会发现如今带给你们欢乐的，正是当初带给你们忧愁的。
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
当你们悲哀时，再审视自己的心灵，你们会发现如今带给你们忧愁的，正是当初带给你们欢乐的。
Some of you say, "Joy is greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater."
你们当中一些人说：“欢乐甚于忧愁。”而另一些人说：“否，忧愁甚于欢乐。”
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
但我对你们说，它们是不可分的。
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
它们一同降临，当其中一个独自与你同席时，要记住另一个正在你的床上安眠。
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
的确，你们像摇摆于忧愁与欢乐之间的一架天平。
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
只有当你们完全虚空时，你们才会静止，平衡。
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.
当宝藏守护者用你称量他的金银时，必然需要你的欢乐和忧愁升降起伏。

# On Teaching 教育

Then said a teacher, "Speak to us of Teaching."
然后一位教师说，请给我们讲讲教育。
And he said:
他说道：
No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of our knowledge.
无人能够启悟你们，除了那半醒着躺在你们悟性晓光中的东西。
The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness.
走在圣殿阴影下，行于其追随者中的导师，传授的不是他的智慧，而是他的信念和爱。
If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind.
如果他的确睿智，就不会命令你们进入他智慧的殿堂，而是引导你们走向自己心灵的门户。
The astronomer may speak to you of his understanding of space, but he cannot give you his understanding.

The musician may sing to you of the rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot give you the ear which arrests the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it.
音乐家能为你们唱出响彻四方的旋律，但却无法赋予你们捕捉这旋律的耳朵，或回应这旋律的歌喉。
And he who is versed in the science of numbers can tell of the regions of weight and measure, but he cannot conduct you thither.

For the vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.
因为一个人的洞察力不能将其羽翼借给另一个人。
And even as each one of you stands alone in God's knowledge, so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of God and in his understanding of the earth.
就像你们每一个人都独自站在上帝的知识世界，你们每个人对上帝和世界的认识与理解也彼此独立。

# On Giving 施与

Then said a rich man, "Speak to us of Giving."
一位富人接下来说，请为我们讲施与。
And he answered:
他答道：
You give but little when you give of your possessions.
当你们拿出自己的财产时，你们的施与微不足道。
It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.
你们奉献自己时，才是真正的施与。
For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?
因为你们的财产不就是一些你们担心明天可能需要才占有、才保护的东西吗？
And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?
而明天，明天又能给那谨小慎微追随朝圣者，而又把骨头埋藏在荒沙里的狗带来什么？
And what is fear of need but need itself?
除了需要本身，你们还需要什么呢？
Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, thirst that is unquenchable?
当井水满溢，你对干渴的恐惧岂不就是一种无法解脱的干渴？
There are those who give little of the much which they have -- and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.
有些人只捐弃自己财产中的一点一些——他们是为得到认可而施与，而他们隐藏的欲望使他们的馈赠不成为美。
And there are those who have little and give it all.
也有一些人，他们拥有甚少，却全部付出。
These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.
他们相信生命和生命的赠礼，他们的储柜从不空虚。
There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.
有些人快乐地施与，这快乐就是他们的回报。
And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.
有些人痛苦地施与，这痛苦就是他们的洗礼。
And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;
还有一些人，给予时并不觉得痛苦，也不是为了寻求快乐，或布善施德；
They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.
他们施与，就像山谷那边的桃金娘散发芳香。
Though the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.
上帝通过这些人之手施教，透过他们的双眸向大地微笑。
It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;
被祈求时施与固然很好，但更高的境界是通过体察，在别人开口前相赠。
And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving.
对于慷慨的人，能找到乐于接受馈赠的人较之施与本身是更深的快乐。
And is there aught you would withhold?
你有什么不能舍弃的呢？
All you have shall some day be given;
总有一天，你所有的一切都将留与他人；
Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.
所以现在就馈赠吧，把奉献的时机留给你自己，而不是你的继承人。
You often say, "I would give, but only to the deserving."
你们常说：“我会解囊，但只为值得的人。”
The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.
你们果园中的树木不会这样说，你们草地上的羊群也不会这样说。
They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.
因为奉献，它们才会生存，而拒绝只会带来灭亡。
Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights is worthy of all else from you.
一个配得到自己白昼与黑夜的人，无疑配从你们这里获得其他一切。
And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.
一个配从生命之海中取饮的人，也配从你们的小溪里汲满水杯。
And what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?
什么样的美德能超过接受的勇气、信任、甚至慈悲？
And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?
你是谁，值得人们撕开胸膛、摘下自尊的面纱，让你看到他们赤裸的价值和他们无愧的尊严？
See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.
先审视一下自己是否配作一个馈赠者，一件施与的工具。
For in truth it is life that gives unto life -- while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.
因为一切都是生命对生命的馈赠——而你，将自己视为施主的你，不过是一个见证。
And you receivers -- and you are all receivers -- assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.
至于你们这些受惠者——你们的确都是受惠者——毋须背负感恩戴德的重担，以免给自己以至施与者套上枷锁。
Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;
不如与施与者凭借馈赠，如同凭借一对翅膀，一起飞翔，
For to be overmindful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the free-hearted earth for mother, and God for father.
因为耿耿于欠负，就是怀疑那以乐善好施的大地为母，以上帝为父的施与者的慷慨了。
